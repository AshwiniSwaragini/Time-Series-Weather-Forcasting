# Time-Series-Weather-Forcasting
This tutorial uses a weather time series dataset recorded by the Max Planck Institute for Biogeochemistry.  This dataset contains 14 different features such as air temperature, atmospheric pressure, and humidity. These were collected every 10 minutes, beginning in 2003. For efficiency, you will use only the data collected between 2009 and 2016.
